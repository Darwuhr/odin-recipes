        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Patate in tecia are potatoes that are boiled, cut into pieces, 
            then pan-fried with onions and pancetta until they develop a nice golden crust.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Potatoes</b>: 1 kilo yellow fleshed potatoes.</li>
            <li><b>Pancetta</b>: 100g.</li>
            <li><b>Onion</b> One small onion.</li>
            <li><b>Butter or lard</b>: 50g. </li>
            <li><b>Broth</b>: Some homemade broth.</li>
            <li><b>Seasonings</b>: Salt and pepper.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Boil the potatoes, still in their jackets, until they are almost tender 
                but still a bit firm. Let cool, and when they’ve cooled off enough to handle, 
                peel and cut them up.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the potatoes are boiling, in a large non-stick or well-seasoned cast iron 
                or carbon steel skillet, gently sauté the pancetta and onion in your chosen fat 
                until lightly brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the cut up potatoes to the skillet and raise the heat. 
                Turn the potatoes with the pancetta and onion. Add a half-ladleful of broth 
                and let simmer until the potatoes are fully tender, adding more broth if needed. 
                Turn the potatoes from time to time and mash them with a fork into a rough hash. 
                Taste and season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the potatoes are fully tender, let any remaining broth evaporate. 
                Continue to sauté but stop turning the potatoes so a nice crust forms on the bottom.
                Once the potatoes are fully tender, let any remaining broth evaporate. 
                Continue to sauté but stop turning the potatoes so a nice crust forms on the bottom.
            </li>
            <li>Now you can either flip the potatoes over in one piece, forming a kind of pancake, 
                as you might a frittata or, closer to this dish, a frico, or simply turn flip the potatoes 
                in parts with a spatula. Keep flipping if need be so the potatoes have a nice crust 
                all over.
            </li>
            <li>Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
